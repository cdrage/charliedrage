I am a programmer, a tinkering of things. I strive to be as efficient and unobtrusive as possible. From the simplicity and minimalism of interfaces, to the straightforwardness of installations and implementations. I believe in the Unix philosophy of designing small yet capable software. As Doug McIlroy said; "Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.". I also believe in the tecnology movement from single high-powered devices to small embedded devices and 'cloud' computing.  My favourite programming language is `Ruby`. 

With that out of the way, my name is Charlie. I enjoy traveling, programming (android, ruby, python, java), languages (at the moment, learning Dutch!) and of course, the internet. I follow a minimalistic lifestyle which I mostly take out upon my Linux dotfiles.

I graduated from the University of Ontario Institute of Technology where I studied Computer Networking and Security. I will be continuing my education by taking my Masters of Computer Security at the Radboud Nijmegen University in The Netherlands.

I also ride around on my motorcycle.

This blog's purpose will be a documentation of both Linux (mainly Debian) developments, hardships, and installations as well as my travels.
