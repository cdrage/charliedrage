Tired of trying to figure out what password to generate?

Put this in your __.bashrc__ or __.zshrc__ and smoke it.

```bash
xkcd_password() {
  shuf -n5 /usr/share/dict/words | sed -e ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/ /g;s/'\''//g;s/\b\(.\)/\u\1/g;s/ //g'
  }
```

```bash
~                                                                             ⍉
▶ xkcd_password

▶ 
```
