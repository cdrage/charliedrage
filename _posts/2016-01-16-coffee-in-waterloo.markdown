I admit it, I drink way too much coffee and spend most of my programming time in a cafe. That's the life of working remote, changing pace.

Here are my favourite places in Waterloo / Kitchener.

Note: Only pictures of coffee (generally a latte). Go experience the atmosphere yourself :)

My favourite place. Beautifully designed, homely and stays open later than any other hipster-ish cafe's in Waterloo. All caffenated drinks are double-esressos.
