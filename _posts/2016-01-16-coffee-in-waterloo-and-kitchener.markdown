I admit it, I drink way too much coffee and spend most of my programming time in a cafe. That's the life of working remote, changing pace and traveling around all the time.

Here are my favourite places in Waterloo and Kitchener.

Note: Generally, only pictures of coffee (most likely a latte). Go experience the atmosphere yourself!

### DVLB (Death Valley's Little Brother)

My favourite place. Beautifully designed, homely and stays open later than any other hipster-ish cafe's in Waterloo. All caffenated drinks are double-esressos.

### Seven Shores

Feels like a small Toronto cafe. Caffeine kicks in like a mothertrucker.

### Balzac's Cafe

The latte is the size of a freakin' soup bowl. Located in the same building as Communitech and Google.
