On a calm Saturday, I fell out of an airplane.

We flew to 10,500 feet and jumped out of the plane with the photographer leading.

Jumping out of a Cessna 206 and falling through the clouds at 142 feet per second.

Skydiving had been something on my bucket list for years.

One most exhilarating experiences I've ever had, I would do it again in a heartbeat.
